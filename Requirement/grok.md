### Demo Project Overview

To demonstrate your fit for the Senior Integration Engineer role at BidOne, I'll plan a compact yet comprehensive demo project that simulates a key business flow: integrating a foodservice buyer's ordering system with a wholesale supplier's inventory and fulfillment system. This aligns with BidOne's focus on "never lose an order" by building reliable, scalable integrations for order placement, processing, and confirmation.

The project, called **OrderFlow Integrator**, will handle:
- Receiving orders from a buyer (e.g., via API or event trigger).
- Validating and enriching the order data.
- Integrating with a supplier's system for inventory checks and fulfillment.
- Sending confirmations and handling errors resiliently.
- Logging and monitoring for observability.

This demo will cover all must-have skills (Azure Logic Apps, Functions, API Management, C#/.NET, REST APIs, secure practices, cloud platforms, Docker/Kubernetes, databases) and nice-to-haves (Kubernetes/microservices). It will be built using Azure as the primary cloud platform, with a focus on reusability, testing, and CI/CD.

The project is designed to be implementable in 1-2 weeks (assuming part-time effort), using free-tier Azure resources where possible. You'll need an Azure subscription, Visual Studio (or VS Code), Docker Desktop, and a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., local Minikube or Azure Kubernetes Service - AKS).

### High-Level Architecture

The system will use a microservices-based architecture with event-driven and API-based integrations:
- **Buyer Side**: Simulates a foodservice business placing orders (e.g., a simple .NET web app or Postman for testing).
- **Integration Layer**: Orchestrates workflows with Azure Logic Apps, triggers Azure Functions for processing, and exposes/manages APIs via Azure API Management.
- **Supplier Side**: A .NET microservice simulating inventory checks and fulfillment.
- **Data Layer**: Azure SQL Database (relational) for order persistence; Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL) for audit logs and telemetry.
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker, orchestrated in Kubernetes.
- **Observability**: Application Insights for telemetry; secure coding with authentication (e.g., Azure AD, API keys).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for pipelines.

Data Flow:
1. Buyer sends order (JSON payload via REST API).
2. API Management routes to Logic App.
3. Logic App triggers Function for validation/enrichment.
4. Function checks inventory via supplier microservice API (using Event Grid for async events if low stock).
5. Persist order in SQL DB; log in Cosmos DB.
6. Send confirmation email/SMS (simulated via Logic App connector).
7. Handle errors (e.g., retry on failure, alert on critical issues).

This ensures end-to-end coverage of integrations, scalability, and resilience.

### Key Components and Technologies

I'll break it down into modular components, mapping to job requirements:

1. **API Development and Management (C#/.NET, REST APIs, API Management)**
   - Build two RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API (C#/.NET 8):
     - **Order Submission API**: POST endpoint to receive orders (e.g., /api/orders). Validates payload (e.g., product ID, quantity, buyer ID).
     - **Supplier Inventory API** (microservice): GET/POST for inventory check and fulfillment (e.g., /api/inventory/check).
   - Secure endpoints: Use JWT authentication (Azure AD) and HTTPS.
   - Expose via Azure API Management: Add policies for rate limiting, caching, and transformation (e.g., mask sensitive data).
   - Demonstrates: Building microservices, secure practices, reusability (e.g., shared libraries for validation).

2. **Workflow Orchestration (Azure Logic Apps, Event Grid)**
   - Create a Logic App workflow:
     - Trigger: HTTP request from API Management.
     - Actions: Call Azure Function for processing; integrate with supplier API; use Event Grid to publish low-stock events.
     - Connectors: Email (for confirmations), SQL/Cosmos DB for data ops.
     - Error Handling: Retry policies, run-after for failed branches.
   - Demonstrates: Designing integrations, event-driven architecture, "never lose an order" via resilient workflows.

3. **Serverless Processing (Azure Functions)**
   - Build two Functions (C#/.NET):
     - **Order Validator Function**: HTTP-triggered; enriches order (e.g., adds timestamps, calculates totals using NuGet packages like Newtonsoft.Json).
     - **Event Handler Function**: Event Grid-triggered; processes low-stock alerts (e.g., notify supplier).
   - Use dependency injection for reusability (e.g., shared repo classes).
   - Demonstrates: Scalable integrations, microservices patterns.

4. **Data Storage (Relational and NoSQL Databases)**
   - **Azure SQL Database**: Store orders (table: Orders with columns like OrderId, BuyerId, Status, Timestamp).
   - **Azure Cosmos DB**: Store logs (container: AuditLogs with items like { "event": "order_processed", "timestamp": "...", "details": {} }).
   - Access via Entity Framework Core (relational) and Cosmos SDK (NoSQL).
   - Demonstrates: Database integration in integrations.

5. **Containerization and Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)**
   - Dockerize the .NET APIs and Functions (multi-stage Dockerfiles for build efficiency).
   - Deploy to Kubernetes:
     - Use Helm charts or YAML manifests for pods/services (e.g., Deployment for supplier microservice, Service for exposure).
     - Set up ingress for API access; secrets for connection strings.
   - Local testing: Minikube; prod-like: AKS.
   - Demonstrates: Cloud-native practices, microservices environments.

6. **Quality, Testing, and Observability**
   - **Testing**: Unit tests (xUnit/NUnit) for APIs/Functions; integration tests for Logic Apps (using Azure Portal tools).
   - **Telemetry**: Integrate Application Insights in .NET code (TrackEvent, TrackException).
   - **Secure Coding**: Input validation, secrets management (Azure Key Vault), OWASP best practices.
   - **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps pipeline: Build Docker images, run tests, deploy to AKS. Include stages for linting, scanning (e.g., SonarQube).
   - Demonstrates: Quality-first engineering, incident response (e.g., alerts on failures).

7. **Leadership and Collaboration Aspects**
   - While this is a solo demo, document design decisions (e.g., in README.md) as if leading a discussion: Why Logic Apps over custom code? Trade-offs in microservices vs. monolith.
   - Include a "mentorship" section: Sample code reviews or best practices guide.
   - Roadmap ideas: Future enhancements like multi-supplier support.

### Implementation Steps

   - Implement auth, telemetry.
   - Write tests.
